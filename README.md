# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by YOURNAME

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
> I spent around 12 hours to finish it.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
> I satisfied with my algorithm, the place.py, placecollection.py. 

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
> About my GUI, because I almost spent 6 hours on it.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
> The algorithm, because I spent less time on them, and the test py are all run well.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
> I think the GUI part will be improved a lot, because I spend lots of time on it, and I can code kivy much better now.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
> I watched class videos, and some class materials on Github to learn kivy.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
> I spent half work-time on my kivy debug, because it always crashed. I checked the debug from pycharm carefully, then overcame those bugs.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
> I think the class saved some time. Because it provides some code already instead of writting all code by myself.
